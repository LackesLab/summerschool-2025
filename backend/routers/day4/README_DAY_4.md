# Day 4: Advanced RAG Agent

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will understand and implement:

1. **Agentic RAG**: Building RAG systems that can reason about what to retrieve
2. **Multi-step Retrieval**: Implementing complex retrieval strategies
3. **Tool Integration**: Combining RAG with external tools and APIs
4. **Advanced Chunking**: Sophisticated document processing techniques

## Core Tasks

### Task 1: Agentic Retrieval System
Build an intelligent retrieval system that:
- Analyzes queries to determine retrieval strategy
- Performs multi-step retrieval when needed
- Combines information from multiple sources

### Task 2: Advanced RAG Pipeline
Create a sophisticated RAG system with:
- Query expansion and refinement
- Re-ranking of retrieved chunks
- Iterative retrieval and generation

### Task 3: Tool-Augmented RAG
Integrate external tools that:
- Complement retrieval with real-time data
- Perform calculations or data processing
- Access external APIs and services

## Implementation Guidelines

Implement your solutions in the `router.py` file in this directory. Use the `/chat` endpoint for the advanced RAG agent.

Advanced considerations:
- Query intent classification
- Dynamic retrieval strategies
- Source reliability assessment
- Multi-modal document handling
- Performance optimization
