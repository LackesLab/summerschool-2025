# Day 2: Reasoning Techniques with LLMs

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will understand and implement:

1. **Self-Consistency**: How to improve LLM reliability through multiple reasoning paths
2. **Tool-Use / Function Calling**: Enabling LLMs to interact with external systems
3. **Plan-and-Solve**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps
4. **Chain-of-Thought**: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning in LLMs

## Core Tasks

### Task 1: Self-Consistency Implementation
Implement a self-consistency mechanism that:
- Generates multiple reasoning paths for the same problem
- Aggregates results to find the most consistent answer
- Improves reliability of LLM outputs

### Task 2: Tool-Use Integration
Create a system that allows the LLM to:
- Call external functions/APIs
- Process tool results
- Integrate tool outputs into responses

### Task 3: Plan-and-Solve Framework
Build a framework that:
- Breaks complex problems into subtasks
- Executes each subtask systematically
- Combines results for final answer

## Implementation Guidelines

Implement your solutions in the `router.py` file in this directory. Use the `/echo` endpoint as your starting point, or create additional endpoints as needed.

Remember to:
- Handle errors gracefully
- Validate inputs and outputs
- Document your approach
- Test with various scenarios
