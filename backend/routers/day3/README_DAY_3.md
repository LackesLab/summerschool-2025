# Day 3: Basic RAG Implementation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will understand and implement:

1. **Document Processing**: How to chunk and embed documents for retrieval
2. **Vector Storage**: Building and querying vector databases
3. **Retrieval Systems**: Implementing semantic search for relevant context
4. **RAG Pipeline**: Combining retrieval with generation for Q&A

## Core Tasks

### Task 1: Document Processing Pipeline
Implement a document processing system that:
- Accepts various document formats (text, PDF, etc.)
- Splits documents into meaningful chunks
- Generates embeddings for each chunk

### Task 2: Vector Database Integration
Build a vector storage system that:
- Stores document embeddings efficiently
- Performs similarity search queries
- Returns relevant chunks for given questions

### Task 3: RAG Question-Answering System
Create a complete RAG system that:
- Takes user questions as input
- Retrieves relevant document chunks
- Generates contextually-informed responses

## Implementation Guidelines

Implement your solutions in the `router.py` file in this directory. Use the `/chat` endpoint for the RAG system.

Key considerations:
- Choose appropriate chunk sizes and overlap
- Select effective embedding models
- Implement relevance scoring
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Provide source attribution in responses
